During this time, she received training in Carnatic music, Kuchipudi dance, and piano.

The book achieved mASSIVE success, with a 4.3-star rating on Goodreads. As a result of her book, Dasu received many accolades including an article in The Hindu.\n\n            Dasu graduated from Hiranandani Foundation School in 2018 and began attending the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies molecular and cell biology with a minor in creative writing.

Fearing that this high-pitched declaration of her love for Harry Potter was not enough, she met one of her best friends at an inter school Harry Potter competition, and enrolled in a class at UC Berkeley dedicated exclusively to studying the Harry Potter novels and movies through discussions and reenactments. On one occasion, she even used this class as an excuse to ditch a Laya event featuring violin prodigy Kamalakiran Vinjamuri.\n\n            Dasu is also a big fan of the Star Wars franchise and the MCU, the TV sitcoms Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, and Gilmore Girls (at least, until the Beginning of the End), as well as crime shows such as Elementary. In her free time, Dasu likes to read, design calendars, somnotext, write fan-fictions, and geek out over fusion music.

I’m so lucky that the I made the right decision on Sept. 14, because that day onwards, I gained a friend who became my positivity, my fun-teacher, and life cheerleader. Whether it be a random idea of going to SF at midnight or a drive to Berkeley Marina to de-stress, you’ve agreed to my crazy ideas, all the while making me more comfortable to be impulsive. And that’s a good thing. Along the way, you’ve also shown me the importance of passion. When we created the Sufi group, we all threw ourselves into a genre we had never sung, let alone be trained in. And yet, in learning Raag Yaman, we spent hours on simple phrases, and watching you give your all to something just to improve was probably the peak of my semester, because you showed me I don’t need to know anything going into an experience, but if I work hard, I’ll achieve anything. You are a pinnacle of exploration and hard work and watching you take on this year one step at a time has been unbelievably motivating. You’ve given me a life where my first priority is not being first, it’s friends. It’s because of people like you where I understood that.
