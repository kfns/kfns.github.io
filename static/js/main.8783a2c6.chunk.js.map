After brief stints in Columbus, Ohio and Cupertino, California, she moved with her family to Hyderabad in 2008 where she completed much of her schooling. During this time, she received training in Carnatic music, Kuchipudi dance, and piano. In 2015, she found her true calling and moved to the Hindustani music capital of the world, Mumbai, where she attended Hiranandani Foundation School.`\n        },\n        {\n            title: `2015 - Present: Enchantress of Elektra and Beyond`,\n            content: `On November 16, 2015, Dasu published her first novel, Enchantress of Elektra, a fantasy fiction she began writing at the tender age of 12. The book achieved mASSIVE success, with a 4.3-star rating on Goodreads. As a result of her book, Dasu received many accolades including an article in The Hindu.\n\n            Dasu graduated from Hiranandani Foundation School in 2018 and began attending the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies molecular and cell biology with a minor in creative writing. She is a member of Laya of Berkeley, a South Asian classical music fusion performance group, where she doubles as a vocalist and a keyboardist.\n            \n            On April 13, 2020, Dasu celebrated her twentieth birthday by reading this very sentence.\n            `\n        },\n        {\n            title: `Influence and Style`,\n            content: `In a report with The Hindu, Dasu has said with shrillness in her voice that she is a big fan of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series and that the style and genres of those books inspired her to write Enchantress of Elektra. Fearing that this high-pitched declaration of her love for Harry Potter was not enough, she met one of her best friends at an inter school Harry Potter competition, and enrolled in a class at UC Berkeley dedicated exclusively to studying the Harry Potter novels and movies through discussions and reenactments. On one occasion, she even used this class as an excuse to ditch a Laya event featuring violin prodigy Kamalakiran Vinjamuri.\n\n            Dasu is also a big fan of the Star Wars franchise and the MCU, the TV sitcoms Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, and Gilmore Girls (at least, until the Beginning of the End), as well as crime shows such as Elementary. In her free time, Dasu likes to read, design calendars, somnotext, write fan-fictions, and geek out over fusion music.

You are one of the best friends I’ve made at Cal, and  I’ve had so much fun getting to know you over the last two years and I can’t wait to LIVE with you for the next two years! There’s no one else I’d rather send Harry Potter and Bollywood tiktoks to <3  Lots and lots of love <3 -Swathi `\n        },\n        {\n            name: 'Ujjaini',\n            content: `KAIVALLYA!\n            My north-south indian best frn! Hope that this surprise finds you well— with new obstacles comes new innovation yeeet! I’m so lucky that the I made the right decision on Sept. 14, because that day onwards, I gained a friend who became my positivity, my fun-teacher, and life cheerleader. Whether it be a random idea of going to SF at midnight or a drive to Berkeley Marina to de-stress, you’ve agreed to my crazy ideas, all the while making me more comfortable to be impulsive. And that’s a good thing. Along the way, you’ve also shown me the importance of passion. When we created the Sufi group, we all threw ourselves into a genre we had never sung, let alone be trained in. And yet, in learning Raag Yaman, we spent hours on simple phrases, and watching you give your all to something just to improve was probably the peak of my semester, because you showed me I don’t need to know anything going into an experience, but if I work hard, I’ll achieve anything. You are a pinnacle of exploration and hard work and watching you take on this year one step at a time has been unbelievably motivating. You’ve given me a life where my first priority is not being first, it’s friends. It’s because of people like you where I understood that. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. \n            \n            Here’s to more Hindustani Adele, Aaj Jaane ki Zidd na Karo, and late-night Parineeta!\n            Lots of love, Ujjaini\n            `\n        }\n    ]\n\n    state = {\n        open: -1,\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const { classes } = this.props;\n        return (\n            <div className={classes.root}>\n                {this.messages.map((msg, i) => {\n                    const path = `./message_photos/${msg.name.toLowerCase()} Cropped.jpg`;\n                    return (\n                        <Card className={classes.card} variant=\"outlined\">\n                            <CardHeader title={msg.name}/>\n                            <CardContent>\n                                <img\n                                className={classes.image}\n                                src={require('' + path)}\n                                width='100%'\n                                // height='100em'\n                                />\n                            </CardContent>\n                            <CardActions className={classes.actions}>\n                                <Button onClick={() => {\n                                    this.setState({\n                                        open: i,\n                                    })\n                                }}>\n                                    <span className={classes.viewMessage}>View Message</span>\n                                </Button>\n                            </CardActions>\n                        </Card>\n                    )\n                })}\n                {\n                    this.messages.map((msg, i) => {\n                        let { name, content } = msg;\n                        if (!content) content = '(Message here)';\n                        let newText = content.split('\\n').map((item, i) => {\n                            return <p key={i}>{item}</p>;\n                        });\n                        return (\n                        <Dialog onClose={this.handleClose} aria-labelledby=\"simple-dialog-title\"\n                        open={this.state.open === i}>\n                            <DialogTitle className={classes.dialogTitle}>{name}</DialogTitle>\n                            <hr />\n                            <div className={classes.messageContent}>\n                                {newText}\n                            </div>\n                        </Dialog>\n                        );\n                    })\n                }\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n\n    handleClose = () => {\n        this.setState({\n            open: -1,\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(Messages);","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Slide } from 'react-slideshow-image';\n \nconst slideImages = [\n  './giftbox.png',\n];\n\nconst images = slideImages.map(s => require('' + s));\n \nconst properties = {\n  duration: 5000,\n  transitionDuration: 500,\n  infinite: true,\n  indicators: true,\n  arrows: true,\n  pauseOnHover: true,\n  onChange: (oldIndex, newIndex) => {\n    console.log(`slide transition from ${oldIndex} to ${newIndex}`);\n  }\n}\n \nconst Slideshow = () => {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"slide-container\">\n        <Slide {...properties}>\n            {\n                images.map((img, i) => {\n                    return (\n                        <div className=\"each-slide\">\n                            <img\n                            src={img}\n                            />\n                            <span>{`Slide ${i + 1}`}</span>\n                        </div>\n                    )\n                })\n            }\n        </Slide>\n      </div>\n    )\n}\n\nclass Photos extends Component {\n\n    render() {\n\n        const embed = `\n        `\n\n        return (\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: embed}} />\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Photos;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
