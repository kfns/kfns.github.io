As a result of her book, Dasu received many accolades including an article in The Hindu.\n\n            Dasu graduated from Hiranandani Foundation School in 2018 and began attending the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies molecular and cell biology with a minor in creative writing.

Can't wait to go on that hike with you and Rishi next sem omg (also we're doing something cute for your 20th!!)\n            Love, Shivani\n            "},{name:"Swathi",content:"Kaivallya!! I hope you have the best 20th birthday (given the circumstances)! I wish we could celebrate in person, but drastic situations call for creative measures ;). You are one of the best friends I\u2019ve made at Cal, and  I\u2019ve had so much fun getting to know you over the last two years and I can\u2019t wait to LIVE with you for the next two years! There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather send Harry Potter and Bollywood tiktoks to <3  Lots and lots of love <3 -Swathi "},{name:"Ujjaini",content:"KAIVALLYA!\n            My north-south indian best frn! Hope that this surprise finds you well\u2014 with new obstacles comes new innovation yeeet! I\u2019m so lucky that the I made the right decision on Sept. 14, because that day onwards, I gained a friend who became my positivity, my fun-teacher, and life cheerleader. Whether it be a random idea of going to SF at midnight or a drive to Berkeley Marina to de-stress, you\u2019ve agreed to my crazy ideas, all the while making me more comfortable to be impulsive. And that\u2019s a good thing. Along the way, you\u2019ve also shown me the importance of passion. When we created the Sufi group, we all threw ourselves into a genre we had never sung, let alone be trained in. And yet, in learning Raag Yaman, we spent hours on simple phrases, and watching you give your all to something just to improve was probably the peak of my semester, because you showed me I don\u2019t need to know anything going into an experience, but if I work hard, I\u2019ll achieve anything. You are a pinnacle of exploration and hard work and watching you take on this year one step at a time has been unbelievably motivating. You\u2019ve given me a life where my first priority is not being first, it\u2019s friends. It\u2019s because of people like you where I understood that. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. \n            \n            Here\u2019s to more Hindustani Adele, Aaj Jaane ki Zidd na Karo, and late-night Parineeta!\n            Lots of love, Ujjaini\n            "}],e.state={open:-1},e.handleClose=function(){e.setState({open:-1})},e}return Object(o.a)(s,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this,t=this.props.classes;return l.a.createElement("div",{className:t.root},this.messages.map((function(n,o){var i="./message_photos/".concat(n.name.toLowerCase()," Cropped.jpg");return l.a.createElement(h.a,{className:t.card,variant:"outlined"},l.a.createElement(u.a,{title:n.name}),l.a.createElement(d.a,null,l.a.createElement("img",{className:t.image,src:a(146)(""+i),width:"100%"})),l.a.createElement(p.a,{className:t.actions},l.a.createElement(m.a,{onClick:function(){e.setState({open:o})}},l.a.createElement("span",{className:t.viewMessage},"View Message"))))})),this.messages.map((function(a,n){var o=a.name,i=a.content;i||(i="(Message here)");var r=i.split("\n").map((function(e,t){return l.a.createElement("p",{key:t},e)}));return l.a.createElement(y.a,{onClose:e.handleClose,"aria-labelledby":"simple-dialog-title",open:e.state.open===n},l.a.createElement(g.a,{className:t.dialogTitle},o),l.a.createElement("hr",null),l.a.createElement("div",{className:t.messageContent},r))})))}}]),s}(s.Component);t.default=Object(c.a)({root:{display:"flex",flexWrap:"wrap",justifyContent:"center",alignItems:"center"},card:{margin:"3%",width:"25%"},image:{},actions:{display:"flex",justifyContent:"flex-end"},viewMessage:{fontWeight:"bolder"},dialogTitle:{borderBottom:"1px solid black",margin:8},messageContent:{marginLeft:16,marginRight:16,marginBottom:8,marginTop:0}})(f)},95:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=a(14),o=a(15),i=a(16),r=a(17),s=a(0),l=a.n(s),c=(a(229),["./giftbox.png"].map((function(e){return a(146)(""+e)})),function(e){Object(r.a)(a,e);var t=Object(i.a)(a);function a(){return Object(n.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return l.a.createElement("div",{dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:"\n        "}})}}]),a}(s.Component));t.default=c},96:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,"register",(function(){return o})),a.d(t,"unregister",(function(){return r}));var n=Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));function o(e){if("serviceWorker"in navigator){if(new URL("",window.location.href).origin!==window.location.origin)return;window.addEventListener("load",(function(){var t="".concat("","/service-worker.js");n?(!function(e,t){fetch(e,{headers:{"Service-Worker":"script"}}).then((function(a){var n=a.headers.get("content-type");404===a.status||null!=n&&-1===n.indexOf("javascript")?navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister().then((function(){window.location.reload()}))})):i(e,t)})).catch((function(){console.log("No internet connection found.
